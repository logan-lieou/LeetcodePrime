## Binary Operations

There's a lot of built in binary operations, such as `|` and `&` so I will go through them here, obviouslly `|` is or and `&` is and, some less common operations include `>>` and `<<` as well as `^` the `^` is the xor operator which can be pretty useful. `>>` is the right shift operator which takes value on the right and the number of bits to shift on the left, same for the left shit operator `<<`.

## Example

`&` the code `1 & 2` produces `0` because `01 & 10 = 00`

`|` the code `1 | 2` produces `3` because `01 & 10 = 11`

`^` the code `5 ^ 3` produces `2` because `101 ^ 011 = 010`

`>>` the code `2 >> 1` produces `1` because `10 >> 01 = 2^0`

`<<` the code `2 << 3` produces `8` because `10 << 100 << 100 << 1000 = 2^3`
